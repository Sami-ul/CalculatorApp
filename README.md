## Setup for using
- Go to releases and download the executable to just run it and test it out
## Setup to look at code
- Click the green code button, if you know how to use the command line interface method, you may use that, otherwise just download the zip
## Overview
- CLR clears the input field
- Works like a normal calculator app
  - Pressing equals multiple times will repeat the operation on the new number
  - The result can be used to calculate further, no need to retype
## Files
